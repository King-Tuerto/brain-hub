**Tool name:** Exam Study Planner — turns a pasted syllabus into a week-by-week study plan up to the exam date, ending with 5 practice questions on the first week's topics.

**Inputs:**
- **Paste your class syllabus** (required) — example: "Week 1: Supply and demand; Week 2: Market structures; Week 3: Elasticity; …"
- **Exam date** (optional) — example: "2026-12-10"

**Output** — the answer must have these sections, in order:
1. **Study Plan** — one entry per week, each naming that week's topics taken from the syllabus. If an exam date was given, weeks are dated from today through the exam week. If not, weeks are numbered instead.
2. **Practice Questions** — exactly 5 questions, all based only on the first week's topics.
3. **Summary** — added automatically by the hub; 2–3 sentences.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A1: The Study Plan has one entry for every week from today through the week containing the exam date, when an exam date was given.
- A2: When the exam date is left blank, the Study Plan is organized by week number instead of calendar dates, and the answer says it did this because no exam date was given.
- A3: Every topic named in the Study Plan comes from the pasted syllabus, in the order the syllabus presents them.
- A4: The Practice Questions section contains exactly 5 questions, all about topics from the first week of the plan.
- A5: The answer ends with a Summary section.

**Blank inputs:** If the exam date is left blank, the tool does not invent or guess one. It builds the plan using week numbers instead of dates and tells the student it did so because no exam date was given.
