I'm a university student at the start of a semester, using my syllabus to build a study plan.

Today's date: {{today}}

My syllabus:
{{syllabus}}

My exam date: {{exam_date}}

If my exam date is (not provided), don't guess one. Instead, build the study plan
from the syllabus alone: cover every topic in it, organized week by week, and say
that this is what you did because no exam date was given yet.

Break the syllabus into a week-by-week study plan, one week at a time, from now
until the exam date (or through the whole syllabus if there is no exam date),
naming the topics to study each week. Use only topics that appear in the
syllabus I pasted.

Then look at only the first week's topics in that plan and write exactly five
practice questions based on them.
