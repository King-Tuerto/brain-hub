**Syllabus Study Planner** — turns a pasted class syllabus into a week-by-week study plan leading up to the exam, plus 5 practice questions on the first week's topics.

**Inputs**
- **Class syllabus** (required) — paste the full syllabus text. Example: "Week 1: Intro & history. Week 2: Supply and demand. Week 3: Market structures. Final exam covers all weeks."
- **Exam date** (optional) — the date of the exam. Example: "2026-11-18"

**Output** — the answer must have these sections, in order:
1. **Study Plan** — one entry per week, from today until the exam, each naming at least one topic taken from the syllabus. If the exam date falls within a week, that week still gets exactly one entry (never split into day-by-day blocks or a separate Exam Day entry).
2. **Practice Questions** — exactly 5 questions, with answers, covering only the first week's topics.
3. **Summary** (added automatically) — 2–3 sentences.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A1: The Study Plan section has exactly one entry for every week counting from today through the exam date (inclusive of the exam week), with exactly one entry for the week containing the exam date — never split into day-by-day blocks or a separate Exam Day entry.
- A2: If no exam date was given, the Study Plan section covers exactly 8 weeks, and one line states that 8 weeks was assumed because no exam date was given.
- A3: The Practice Questions section contains exactly 5 questions.
- A4: Every practice question, every one of its answer options, and its answer explanation uses only a topic word that appears under Week 1 in the Study Plan; no question, option, or answer explanation uses a topic word that appears only under a later week.
- A5: Every week listed in the Study Plan names at least one topic taken from the pasted syllabus.
- A6: The Summary section is 2–3 sentences.

**Blank inputs** — if the exam date is left blank, the plan covers 8 weeks instead of counting to an exam date, and the Study Plan section says this was assumed.
